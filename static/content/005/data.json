We had a pretty good connection so we decided to have dinner as well.\nAfter having a few drinks one thing lead to another and ended up back at my place, we hooked up and went to sleep.\nMiddle the night I wake up. She\u2019s intensely staring at me while she\u2019s crouched behind the bed. I asked her if everything is alright, she said yes and got back into bed... I thought \u201clittle creepy, but probably nothing to worry about.\u201d\nShe lays down to cuddle with me and she\u2019s wet. At the time, I was like \u201cdamn I must just be a stallion.\u201d Fast forward to the morning, she\u2019s gone and there\u2019s a wet puddle beside the bed.\nshe peed on my floor\nI still don\u2019t understand it.

I knew it was him because he\u2019d just be silent and I could hear him breathing.

I never did.\nEdit 3: some people are asking me how I found out about the fake Instagram account so here it goes:\nThe reason I was at a restaurant was because my sister had flown in from Dublin to visit my dad for a weekend and she made plans to meet her friends for tapas. I drove her to the restaurant and her friends saw me drop her off and asked me to stay, I did.\nAfter a while, I saw him and he yelled, the waiter threatened to call the police, and after the madness I sat back down and we all looked at each other like WTF.\nI wondered how TF he knew I was there and the only way he could have known was because one of my sister\u2019s friend put up a story where we were all saying \u201csaluuuuud!\u201d with our drinks and she saw that one 40+ people saw the story.\nWe ended up finding his profile and realized that he had followed EVERYONE I followed so that\u2019s how.

I was a sophomore in college and she was a junior or senior at the same school. The first time we ever hung out, I went over to her apartment and we just watched some Netflix and hung out.

She told me she would love to and just hit her up whenever and we\u2019ll make some plans.\nWe start texting/snap chatting throughout the week and organize some plans for the following weekend. Out of nowhere, she starts sending me unsolicited nudes. Never once asked for them and when we were hanging out the weekend prior, there was no sexual activity at any level. We quite literally Netflix and chilled. It caught me off guard, but I was more than cool with it. I\u2019m a young college guy and this hot older chick wants to send me nudes after only hanging out one time? Say less.\nFast forward to the weekend, she comes to my apartment and we\u2019re hanging out with my roommates watching something on TV. She asks me if she can stay the night, and after sending nudes to me all week, I kind of figured what was up, so in my head I\u2019m like \u201c....uhh fuck yes\u201d. But I tell her of course and to be polite I offer to sleep on the couch because we\u2019ve only known each other for all of about 2 weeks and have only seen each other in person one time prior. She tells me she\u2019d rather me sleep in my bed with her, so I know it\u2019s on.\nWe get to Netflix and chilling in my room and I make a move. We start to hook up and eventually wind up having sex. I wore a condom and finished inside of it and tossed it off to my side of the bed. As we\u2019re laying there after a few minutes, she gets up abruptly, comes around to my side of the bed and grabs the condom off the floor and runs into the bathroom. I\u2019m a little confused, maybe a little concerned but kind of brush it off.

I\u2019m a little concerned thinking this girl just fell in my bathroom and cracked her head open or something. I go to open the door and she is standing in my shower with one leg propped up trying to shove the condom up her vagina after she flipped it inside out. I freak out, no clue what to do.

Ok sure. Dude orders 2 large subs from PotBelly and a milkshake. Downs it. No judgment, he's 6'4, 210 lbs, younger still growing, by all means. I didn't think anything of it until later...\nWe end up messing around a bit and fall asleep in bed. I wake up to my front door opening and closing several times over a 5 minute period. My dogs are going nuts, and it's 1am. What the heck is this guy doing?? I open the door to my room that opens up to the rest of my apartment and my bathroom is to the left where the light is on and the door is wide open, I walk around the corner to make eye contact with Dude who is in a squatting position over my toilet, with a stick, poking around in murky brown poop water that is milimeters from overflowing onto my bathroom floor. Horrified, he yells, \" Stop looking at me! Go back to bed! I have it under control!\" I'm still waking up trying to understand what i'm seeing and what's going on, and I just start nervous laughing I don't know what else to do. He yells, \"Why don't you have a plunger?!?\" And I said I don't know I never needed one until now!! He tells me to go back to bed he has it under control, i'm so disturbed, tired, can't process what's happening and have work in the morning I go back to bed. I remember hearing him peek in my room a bit later and heard, \"I fixed it.\" and then heard him leave and my door close behind him.\nThe next morning. I hesitantly approach my toilet to find the water is down. But there is something poking out from the bottom of the toilet like he didn't get it all. Upon further inspection, what I was seeing was the tip of a stick. Some gloves, towels and BBQ tongues later I pulled out approximately 3 foot of stick from my toilet that had broke off, followed by several other stick fragments. Dude had broke several sticks. I heard my door open and close so much, because he was going outside to look for a stick, one would break, he'd go get another. Dude had left drippy poop water stains all over my bathroom floor. He also left my apartment soo fast, that he left his underwear, and undershirt and socks...\nAfter work that day, I went straight to the store and bought a plunger.\nLesson learned.\nTLDR; Guy from tinder ate a bunch right before bed, took a huge poop while I was asleep, woke up to him trying to plunge the toilet with a stick he found outside.\nEdit: I forgot I posted this and just came back so surprised.
